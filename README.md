# PETRINA (Formerly 'birdseye')

PETRINA ("PErsonalized TRaffic INformation Analytics"), a system that provides traffic-related incident monitoring, mapping, and analytics services.

 In particular, we showcase two main functionalities:
 
1. text traffic alert validation based on traffic condition information derived from traffic camera images and 
2. traffic incident correlation based on spatio-temporal proximity of different incident types (e.g., accidents and heavy traffic)

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
